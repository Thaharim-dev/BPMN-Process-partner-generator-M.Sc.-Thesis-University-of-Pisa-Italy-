1. Keep this "my_bpmn_library" folder in a feasible place where all the code can be easily manageable 
 
2.Install setuptools and wheel (if not already installed):
 
 command : "pip install setuptools wheel"

3. Create a Source Distribution:

Open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the root directory of the project (my_bpmn_library),where the setup.py file is located. For example, if you have your project in the "/path/to/development/my_bpmn_library/ "directory, use the "cd" command to navigate to that directory: and run the following command to create a source distribution with the command :
 
command : "python setup.py sdist"

This will generate a dist directory containing a source distribution of your package.


4. Create a Wheel Distribution:

To create a wheel distribution (a binary distribution that can be installed faster), run the following command:

command: "python setup.py bdist_wheel"


5. Distribute Package:

install the package locally for testing by running the following command in the project's root directory:

command: "pip install ."


6. open a python script to the same directory where the library is 

then the following code should be use for parsing the library 

code :

from my_bpmn_package.bpmn_transform import process_bpmn_file

input_file_name = "path/to/your/diagram.bpmn"
process_bpmn_file(input_file_name)
